   \caption{A portion of the computed list of 2-cells of Figure~\ref{fig:2Dcells}, each one described by an array of signed indices of edges. Each one correspond to a column of the signed buondary matrix $\partial_2$, with elements in $\{-1,0,1\}$. The matrix $\partial_2$ is $13086 \times 6331$, and contains $82,\!847,\!466$ elements, including $26,\!172$ non-zeros, with a filling ratio equal to $0.03159\%$. The size of the representation is exactly $2E$.}

\section{Planimetric 2-complex}

Here it is shown both the input and the output of the simplest example of architectural data. The same approach would holds for cartographics applications at any scale (see Figures~\ref{fig:rectangles} and~\ref{fig:testWall}).
